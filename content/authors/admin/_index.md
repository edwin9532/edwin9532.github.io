#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

Hey there! I'm a senior undergraduate student from the Physics Department at the National University of Colombia. I find joy in astrophysics and in programming, so I'm deeply into computational astrophysics. I'm still exploring different fields and open problems, but have been mostly inclined towards Star Clusters, Galaxies, and Cosmology. I also find joy in football, boardgames, reading, nature, watching documentaries, and in appreciating and creating artwork.
